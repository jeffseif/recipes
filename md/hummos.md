# Hummos

From Marilyn Reeves, in the 1990's.

## Ingredients

- 1 can garbanzo beans, drained (but save some aquafaba)
- 2 tablespoons tahini
- 1/4 teaspoon powdered garlic (can also substitute fresh garlic to taste)
- juice from 1 to 2 lemons
- salt to taste

## Directions

1. Add garbanzo beans, tahini, garlic, and juice of one lemon to a food processor
1. Blend, adding aquafaba as needed, until texture is smooth and creamy
1. Taste to determine if more lemon or salt is needed
1. Apply a light sprinkling of paprika on top for color and serve

## Alterations

- Add lemon zest for a brighter flavor
- Add olive oil for a richer flavor
- Add a handful of kalamata olives towards the end to coarsely chop in the food processor
- Add cumin if you're into that
