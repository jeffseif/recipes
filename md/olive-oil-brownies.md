## Ingredients

- 4 ounces (115 grams) unsweetened chocolate, chopped
- 10 tablespoons (130 grams) olive oil
- 1 1/4 cup (250 grams) granulated sugar (reduced from 1 3/4 cups in original recipe)

- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon (15 grams) vanilla extract
- 2/3 cup (85 grams) all-purpose flour
- Pinches of flaky salt to finish

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 350°F.
1. Line an 8×8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, extending it up the sides. Coat any sides or corners of the pan left exposed with nonstick spray.
1.  Place chocolate and olive oil in a large bowl and melt it most of the way in a microwave in 30-second bursts.
1. Off the heat, stir until smooth and fully melted.
1. Whisk in sugar, cocoa, and salt until combined, then whisk in eggs, one at a time, followed by vanilla.
1. Stir in flour and scrape batter into prepared pan, spread until even, then sprinkle lightly with flaky salt.
1. Bake for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly batter-free (reduced from 30-34 minutes in original recipe).
